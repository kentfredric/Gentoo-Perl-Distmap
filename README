            $dm->save( file => '/tmp/foo.x' );

            for my $dist ( sort $dm->dists_in_repo('gentoo') ) {
                    /* see the upstream distnames visible in gentoo */
            }
            for my $dist ( sort $dm->dists_in_repo('perl-experimental') ) {
                    /* see the upstream distnames visible in perl-experimental */
            }
            for my $dist ( sort $dm->multi_repo_dists ) {
                    /* see the dists that exist in more than one repo */
            }
    -       for my $dist ( sort $dm->mapped_dists ) {
                    /* see the dists that have at least one version in the dataset */
                    /* note: dists with empty version sets should be deemed a bug  */
            }

    Interface for creating/augmenting/comparing .json files still to be
    defined, basic functionality only at this time.
